# Student Performance ML Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student performance using
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques with Python.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how factors such as attendance,
Study hours, assignments, and project scores influence all students
performance and certification outcomes.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis,
classification models and regression models.
